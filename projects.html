               <p class="item-intro text-muted">sign up to take action against world hunger!</p>
             <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="images/111.jpg" alt="" />
           <p>The first 1,000 days of a child's life are critical in building their immune system and ensuring they will survive. This is due to the fact that undernutrition accounts for nearly half (48%) all deaths among children worldwide today - which means there needs be more efforts put into providing good nutrition during this period instead! <b>Feed Someone Today Charity Organization</b> has been at the forefront of hunger prevention and treatment since they were founded in 2003. We have developed revolutionary nutrition products, conducted field testing on protocols that are now international best practice for undernourishment programs around world - making us an expert when it comes to fighting this global issue! <br> <br> <b>WHAT WE DO?</b> <br>
<ol>1. Gather, Analyze, and Share Data on Undernutrition:</ol> 

To determine prevalence and the root causes of undernutrition in each local context, we analyze both indirect and direct factors and conduct rigorous assessments. Gathering, analyzing, and sharing this data is essential to guiding an effective, relevant response. 
<br>
<br>
<ol>2. Treat Acute Undernutrition</ol> 

We refer acutely malnourished children who show signs of complications for inpatient treatment. We provide local, accessible, easy-to-reach outpatient treatment for acutely malnourished children without medical complications through a highly effective approach known as Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). 
<br>
<br>
<ol>3. Prevent Undernutrition:</ol> 

We work to prevent chronic and acute undernutrition through an integrated approach that addresses both the direct and underlying causes. In emergencies, we work to ensure that vulnerable children under five, pregnant women, and nursing mothers have access to supplementary food to meet their nutritional needs and prevent them from becoming undernourished.

We also work to educate and support mothers about the importance of breastfeeding for the first six months, and work to improve care and feeding practices to ensure that children from six months to five years of age receive adequate micronutrients and protein for healthy development. Our programs also provide pregnant women and new mothers with peer support groups, facilitated by heath workers, to encourage and promote good nutrition, hygiene, sanitation, and care practices for mothers, infants, and young children.  
<br>
<br>
<ol>4. Local Capacity and Build Resilience:</ol> 

We train local health care workers and partners to screen and treat undernutrition, and we provide technical expertise and support to strengthen local health systems. In severe humanitarian emergencies, we sometimes directly deliver emergency nutrition programs to provide lifesaving treatment to acutely undernourished children, but our aim is to transfer our knowledge, work in partnership with communities, and strengthen what is already working via local health care services to ensure sustainable impact. We also work in more stable contexts, and after crises subside, to build communities' resilience to hunger and mitigate the causes and consequences of undernutrition.
<br>
<br>
<b>NUTRITION FACTS</b> <br>
1. At least 14 million children suffer from severe acute malnutrition around the world. <br> 
2. When a child under five dies, malnutrition is a root cause nearly half of the time. <br>
3. In less than a decade, the number of acutely malnourished children receiving treatment globally has quintupled: increasing from just over one million in 2009 to more than five million in 2018. Still, just a quarter of acutely malnourished children worldwide currently have access to treatment. <br>
4. A $50 donation can provide a full course of life-saving treatment for an undernourished child.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">sign up to take action against unhygienic water supply and drought!</p>
             <img  src="images/112.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"alt="" />
                <p>1,000 children die every day from illnesses caused by dirty water and unhygienic living conditions. We can’t fight malnutrition without tackling the diseases that contribute to it - as part of our integrated approach we bring safe drinking-water services (including handwashing stations) into communities in need all over world!<br> <br> <b>WHAT WE DO?</b> <br>
<ol>1. Provide Access to Safe Water:</ol> 
During emergencies, we truck water into affected areas and install storage tanks and reservoirs. Where water is scarce or unsafe, we drill and decontaminate wells, install hand-pumps, protect natural springs, tap aquifers, rehabilitate damaged infrastructure, and pipe water into hard-to-reach villages and health centers.
<br>
<br>
<ol>2. Promote Sanitation & Hygiene:</ol> 

To prevent outbreaks of disease during a crisis, our teams distribute hygiene kits and build latrines and hand-washing stations. In communities at risk, we construct water filters made from basic materials and teach healthy practices like hand-washing, cooking with clean utensils, and drawing water from protected sources.
<br>
<br>
<ol>3. Ensure Lasting Change:</ol> 
Our commitment to community participation ensures long-term capacity: we train community-based water committees to manage their water and sanitation infrastructure themselves, and organize village health teams to model good sanitation and hygiene practices for their communities long after we leave an area.
<br>
<br>
<b>WATER FACTS</b> <br>
1. Nearly two billion people worldwide drink unsafe water.<br> 
2. One billion people lack access to improved sanitation. <br>
3. More than 5% of all child deaths can be prevented with safe water and sanitation. <br>
4. But there has been tremendous progress. Between 1990 and 2012, 2.3 billion people gained access to an improved drinking water source.

Encompassing a wide array activities customized meet specific needs-their agricultural initiatives help boost local markets while jumpstarting micro enterprise projects which can support families’ nutritional requirements; others focus on providing education about sustainable sources like gardening so people don't rely solely off imported ingredients from overseas suppliers who may not be able provide them with what they need if there is suddenly an interruption due say whole countries experiences severe droughts resulting increased prices consumers. In 2021, <b>Feed Someone Today Foundation</b> improved access to food and income for over 1 million people around the world. We also helped about 150,000 people to prepare for and reduce the risk of disaster. <br> <br> <b>WHAT WE DO?</b> <br>
<ol>1. Evaluate Local Needs:</ol> 
To determine what factors are driving hunger in a given area, Action Against Hunger carries out comprehensive evaluations by collecting and analyzing key data on local assets, resources, and livelihoods strategies. Our teams meet directly with community members to better understand local conditions and create a collaborative plan of action.
<br>
<br>
<ol>2. Provide Long-Term Solutions:</ol> 

Designed in collaboration with local populations, our strategies are context-specific: micro-grant support for families recovering from conflict, seeds and tools for agricultural recovery, livestock and veterinary services where needed, small business assistance, and other programs that help families regain self-sufficiency.
<br>
<br>
<b>Food Security & Livelihoods Facts</b> <br>
1. Micronutrient deficiency affects 2 billion people making them susceptible to long-term, irreversible health effects, as well as having damaging socio-economic consequences.<br> 
2. If women farmers had the same access to productive resources as men, it could reduce the number of hungry people in the world by up to 17% due to increased crop yields.<br>
3. After years of progress, for the fourth year in a row, there has been a rise in world hunger. There are nearly 60 million more undernourished people now than in 2014. If this trend continues, the number of undernourished people will exceed 840 million by 2030.<br>

           <p class="item-intro text-muted">sign up to contribute to our research work!</p>
       <img  src="images/115.jpg"class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" alt="">
                          <p>Feed Someone Today’s research and innovation work focuses on the prevention, treatment, and drivers of undernutrition. Our portfolio is diverse - in 2021 alone, we contributed to 25 active research and innovation projects across 13 countries, in collaboration with 35 partners and with funding support from 14 different institutional donors. Our approach to research marries science with pragmatism – providing us with the nuts and bolts required to create tangible change, even in the most difficult contexts. Our initiatives, which are intentionally and explicitly fit-for-purpose, are designed to achieve the standard of evidence necessary for action on critical issues, while abiding by fundamentally strict ‘do no harm’ principles.

<br>
To accomplish this goal, we:
<br>
1. Advance the evidence base to link research with concrete operational impact; <br>
2. Provide empirically based, data-driven analysis and recommendations; <br>
3. Prioritize partnerships that are profoundly collaborative in nature; and, <br>
4. Identify clear, culturally appropriate and sustainable pathways to scale successful solutions. <br> <br>
Feed Someone Today’s dedicated research and innovation team designs and develops these activities across the organization. Our experts lead a variety of activities, including operational research, impact evaluations, proof of concept pilots, and costing studies, to support the integration of evidence within our practices, policies, and programs.<br> <br> <b>WHAT WE DO?</b> <br>
<ol>1. PREVENTING UNDERNUTRITION:</ol> 
Challenges remain in understanding the best methods to prevent undernutrition, which can vary across different communities and contexts. Our research seeks to better address the underlying causes and drivers of undernutrition, ultimately working to increase resilience and optimize decision-making. This workstream includes: <br> <br>

The Research on Food Assistance for Nutritional Impact (REFANI) program  evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cash-based initiatives in the prevention of acute malnutrition in Pakistan, Niger, and Somalia. <br>

Other research & innovation projects focused on prevention of undernutrition include the Evaluation of Multi-annual and Seasonal Cash Transfers to Prevent Acute Malnutrition (MAM’Out) project.
<br>  
<br>
<ol>2. TREATING UNDERNUTRITION:</ol> 

Fewer than one in four acutely malnourished children currently have access to lifesaving treatment. Our research generates evidence to identify innovative ways to detect acute malnutrition, increase availability and accessibility of quality treatment services, and improve health and nutrition information systems. This workstream includes: <br> <br>

The Identifying the Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Relapse After Recovery from Severe Acute Malnutrition study aims to better understand relapse after treatment for severe acute malnutrition in South Sudan, Somalia, Chad and Mali. <br>

The Innovations in Management of Acute Malnutrition in the Context of COVID-19 project capitalizes upon a unique opportunity to learn from programmatic adaptations during the pandemic and generate evidence that may prove useful in ongoing efforts to improve detection and treatment protocols. <br>

The Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) aimed to examine whether a simplified and unified acute malnutrition treatment protocol would improve coverage, quality, continuity of care and cost-effectiveness in Kenya and South Sudan. <br>

The Implementation Research on Linking the Community Management of Acute Malnutrition and Integrated Community Case Management study evaluated the incorporation of acute malnutrition treatment into existing community-based health services to determine if treatment could effectively be implemented by community health workers in Kenya. <br>

The Evaluating the Effectiveness of Safe Drinking Water in Severe Acute Malnutrition Treatment study investigated whether adding safe drinking water during treatment for severe acute malnutrition reduced treatment time, increased recovery rates, and improved the cost-effectiveness of the treatment program in Pakistan. <br>

Other research projects focused on treatment of undernutrition include the C-Project, the Modelling an Alternative Nutrition Protocol Generalizable to Outpatient Care (MANGO) study,  the Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness and Coverage of Severe Acute Malnutrition Treatment Delivered by Community Health Workers in Study, and the Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial for the Effect of Combining Household Water Treatment and Hygiene Promotion with Standard Outpatient Treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition on Recovery Rates (TISA).
<br>
<br>
<ol>3. RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY & ANTICIPATE NUTRITIONAL RISK:</ol> 
Our research seeks to identify the drivers of undernutrition and predict increases in nutritional risk – ultimately ensuring that decision-makers have timely, evidence-based information on acute malnutrition that allows them to act ahead of a crisis, rather than during or after its peak. This workstream includes: <br> <br>

The Modelling Early Risk Indicators to Anticipate Malnutrition (MERIAM) project aims to improve the prediction and monitoring of acute malnutrition through econometric and computational modelling, with a focus on conflict- and climate-related shocks in Uganda, Kenya, and Somalia. <br>
 
The Click-MUAC project sought to develop and test new devices to detect acute malnutrition, in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of these measurements when used by mothers and caregivers. <br>

The Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Emergencies project examined the technical and political obstacles of producing an independent food insecurity analysis tool in Nigeria. <br>

The Towards Anticipatory Information Systems and Action project explored the linkages between current status information, forecasts, and early warning, in order to identify avenues to improve early action in East Africa. <br>

                          <h2 class="text-uppercase">DROUGHT AMIDST REDUCED RAIN FALLS</h2>
           <p class="item-intro text-muted">More than 13 Million People Face Severe Food Insecurity in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya as Region Heads into Fourth Consecutive Failed Rainy Season.</p>
       <img  src="images/116.jpg"class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" alt="">
                          <p>The people of the Horn of Africa are facing an alarming food crisis as their access to nutritious provisions decreases. Feed Someone Today, as an organization works tirelessly towards helping communities who are experiencing severe and persistent drought that will likely continue into next year's season without adequate rainfall. This trend is already visible this past November when 5 million more individuals were struggling for just enough nutrition largely due to lower crop yields caused initially by lacklustre rains over several years but now made even worse thanks in part also too rapid population growth rates. <br> <i>“The needs right now are higher than we have experienced in generations, and the situation is growing dire,”</i> said Hajir Malim, Feed Someone Today Regional Director of the Horn and Eastern Africa. <i>“Parents are desperate to find basic foods in largely empty markets. In one of our health facilities in Baidoa, Somalia, we are now admitting more than ten malnourished children every single day.”</i> <br>  

<i>“Some of our nutrition stabilization centers are seeing a threefold increase in the number of children admitted with the most severe form of malnutrition compared to a few months ago. Our teams are working to help families cope with the climate crisis with nutrition treatment, cash assistance, and water access programs, but with aid currently 98% underfunded, our work is just the start,”</i> said Ahmed Khalef, Feed Someone Today’s Country Director in Somalia. <i>“Drought could force more than 1.4 million Somalis to leave their homes in search of water and food, which already is leading to conflict over what few resources are left.”</i> <br>   

Ethiopia is seeing the lowest levels of rainfall in more than 40 years, and water levels in key rivers are dipping alarmingly low. <i>“While international donors are focused on conflict in the north, there is a vast need for nutrition and health aid across the country,”</i>  said Maalim. <i>“In 2015, Ethiopia faced the worst drought we had seen in decades; today, the need is already 40% higher than anything we saw then. Millions of livestock have died because of the drought and the number of people affected by malnutrition in Ethiopia has already doubled since the dry season last year.”</i> <br>

Throughout the region, food, water, and hygiene resources grow scarcer by the day. In Kenya, upwards of four million people will need assistance because of drought and 600,000 children younger than age five are already suffering from acute malnutrition. It is estimated that one million head of livestock have already died. <i>“As need escalates, violence is increasing as people find themselves in conflict over limited food and water,”</i> said Jemimah Khamadi, Feed Someone Today’s Country Director for Kenya. <i>“We are working to implement plans for sustainable water management, but that requires additional resources.”</i>  <br> 

Leading humanitarian organizations are calling for $4.4 billion to save lives, reduce conflict, and prevent hunger from worsening. Action Against Hunger urges donors to act before more lives are lost. <i>"Food crises around the globe have taught us that early action saves lives and money. Right now, we need a collective ‘no regrets’ approach to funding and programming to avert a worst-case scenario....The stakes are unprecedented. If something does not change, famine will be on the horizon. Now is the time for donors to stand up before it’s too late.”</i></p>
